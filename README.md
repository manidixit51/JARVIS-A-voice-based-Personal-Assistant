# **JARVIS - AI Voice based Assistant**

## **Project Overview**
Jarvis is an AI-powered voice assistant built in Python. It uses speech recognition to understand spoken commands and responds with appropriate actions through text-to-speech. The project aims to create a personalized assistant capable of handling various tasks through voice interaction.

## **Features**
- **Speech Recognition:** Converts spoken language into text using the `SpeechRecognition` library.
- **Command Processing:** Responds to user commands such as greetings, queries, and tasks.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Provides audio feedback using the `gtts` (Google Text-to-Speech) library.
- **Modular Design:** Easily extendable to add new features and commands.

## **Installation**
### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x
- `pip` (Python package installer)
